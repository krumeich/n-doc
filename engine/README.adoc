= n-doc Image: TeXLive, SQLite, Lua, PlantUML and tools for CC documents

== Overview

The files in this directory are used to create the Docker image for n-doc. The
image contains a custom installation of link:https://www.tug.org/texlive/[TeX
Live], the link:https://www.sqlite.org/[SQLite] database, and the Lua libraries
required to build documents with n-doc.

== Creating the image

The n-doc image is created with the `n-doc` goal of the `Makefile`. The
resulting image will be tagged as `ndesign/n-doc:latest`:

----
make n-doc
----

Additionally, there is a second variant of the n-doc image that contains
link:https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML]. Beware that the resulting images is
significantly bigger than the plain image. This variant is tagged as
`ndesign/n-doc:latest-plantuml`:

----
make n-doc-plantuml
----

Set the environment variable `CACHE_OPTION` to prevent using cached intermediate images. 

----
CACHE_OPTION=--no-cache make image
