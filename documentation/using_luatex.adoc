= Using Lua in n-doc

This document explains how the Lua Interpreter in LuaTeX is used during the
n-doc typesetting process.

== Architecture of the Lua components if the platform

There are several methods for calling the Lua interpreter in LuaTeX. The general
procedure is described very clearly in
link:http://dante.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/luatex/lualatex-doc/lualatex-doc.pdf[the
documentation on CTAN].

The most common use is the `\directlua{}` macro. The arguments of the macro are
handed over to the Lua interpreter and executed there. Furthermore, there are
additional packages that add more ways of providing Lua code. n-doc uses the
link:https://dante.ctan.org/ctan/macros/luatex/latex/luacode/luacode.pdf[Luacode]
package.

In our documents the inclusion of Lua code follows this schema. Example here is
ADV_TDS, all other documents work identically.

``adv_tds/adv_tds.tex``:: is the main document. It includes the common preamble.

``common/common-preamble.tex``:: contains the preamble (everything that comes
before `\begin{document}`) that is identical for all documents. This file
includes all packages and macro definition files. It also sets the module path
for loading Lua libraries.

The Lua code is distributed over several _n-doc packages_:

`common`:: contains utility functions used by all other packages. `common`
  should not contain any logic that is particular to any certification scheme.

`cc_core`:: contains the business logic specific to the CC scheme.

`documents`:: contains business logic for maintaining document versions.

Each of the n-doc packages has the same structure of components. The example
used here is the n-doc package `cc_core`:

`common/cc_core-macros`:: This file contains all the macro definitions for CC
specific use cases.

`common/bridge_cc_core.tex`:: This file contains Lua functions directly related
to the macros in `cc_core-macros.tex`. These functions contain no business logic
but are simple adapters. They represent a bridge to other modules that are
loaded via a `require` statement. These functions call an identically named
function and use `tex.sprint()` to print the result of that call into the output
channel (the PDF file). This is similar to an API.

`lua/bridge_cc_core.lua`:: This module contains the business logic functions
called by `bridge_cc_core.tex`. Functions in this module call the database, the
table generator and other modules. 

`lua/cc_core.lua`:: Contains the code for accessing the database. The module
comprises the tables definitions, the provisioning and the queries. There should
not be any business logic in here, just database access.

`lua/test_bridge_cc_core.lua`:: This module contains integration tests for the business
logic. These tests are integration tests, because they test for correctly
generated LaTeX code.

`lua/test_cc_core.lua`:: This module contain the unit tests for the accessing
the database. These tests are unit tests, because they test for correct Lua data
structures.

== Infrastruktur

Different components work together when executing Lua code. This section
explains which programs must be installed to build the documents. If you use the
Docker image, none of this applies, because all tools are already installed in
the image. LuaTeX contains a fully fledged Lua 5.3 interpreter. However, we need
additional libraries:

* `libsqlite3` for accessing SQLite
* `ftcsv` to parse CSV files
* `luaunit` to run Lua unit tests.

These libraries are installed using the `luarocks` package manager. It loads
source packages, compiles and installs them. Because of version conflicts with
the luarocks installations provided by the Linux distributions, it is
recommended to install luarocks from source.

Follow these steps to install the tool chain:


=== Install the necessary Linux Packages (Ubuntu)

We need Lua and its development libraries in version 5.3:

----
sudo apt install lua5.3 liblua5.3-dev
----

Furthermore, we require an sqlite3 installation together with the source files:

----
sudo apt install sqlite3 libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev
----

=== Install luarocks


----
wget http://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/releases/luarocks-3.7.0.tar.gz
tar xzvf luarocks-3.7.0.tar.gz 
cd luarocks-3.7.0/
./configure 
make build
sudo make install
----

=== Install libsqlite3, ftcsv, luaunit

----
sudo luarocks install lsqlite3
sudo luarocks install ftcsv
sudo luarocks install luaunit
----


Check if everything was installed correctly by running a small integration test:
----
cc-author@cc-vm:~$ lua
Lua 5.3.5  Copyright (C) 1994-2018 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
> l = require "lsqlite3"
> print (l)
table: 0x5580b5f885e0
----

When the interpreter has loaded the lsqlite3 library correctly, it prints the addess of the table containing the module as in the version above. If something went wrong, there will be an error message (example for a non-existing library `lsqlite3a`):

----
> x = require "lsqlite3a"
stdin:1: module 'lsqlite3a' not found:
	no field package.preload['lsqlite3a']
	no file '/usr/local/share/lua/5.2/lsqlite3a.lua'
	no file '/usr/local/share/lua/5.2/lsqlite3a/init.lua'
	no file '/usr/local/lib/lua/5.2/lsqlite3a.lua'
	no file '/usr/local/lib/lua/5.2/lsqlite3a/init.lua'
	no file '/usr/share/lua/5.2/lsqlite3a.lua'
	no file '/usr/share/lua/5.2/lsqlite3a/init.lua'
	no file './lsqlite3a.lua'
	no file '/usr/local/lib/lua/5.2/lsqlite3a.so'
	no file '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lua/5.2/lsqlite3a.so'
	no file '/usr/lib/lua/5.2/lsqlite3a.so'
	no file '/usr/local/lib/lua/5.2/loadall.so'
	no file './lsqlite3a.so'
stack traceback:
	[C]: in function 'require'
	stdin:1: in main chunk
	[C]: in ?
----

=== Installation on macOS

The components that are installed with a package manager in Linux can also be installed with a package manager on macOS (e.g. link:https://brew.sh/[Homebrew]):

----
brew install lua
----

It is recommended to install a custom SQLite3 because the stock SQLite3 on macOS
lacks the header files. You need a compiler for that. Use either the XCode
command line utilities or install a tool chain via brew. Explaining this is out
of scope for this manual.

Once you have a C compiler running, download and compile SQLite3 (choose a newer version : 

----
curl -O https://sqlite.org/2021/sqlite-autoconf-3360000.tar.gz
tar xzvf sqlite-autoconf-3360000.tar
cd sqlite-autoconf-3360000
./configure; make
sudo make install
----

From then on, follow the instructions for Linux.

=== Installation on Windows

Sorry, no experience there. Use the Docker image. It works very well.
